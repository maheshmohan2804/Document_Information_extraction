However, studies with large samples on the factors of NEC in China have not been reported. This meta-analysis aims to systematically review the literature to explore the influencing factors of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants in China and provide a reference for the prevention of NEC.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in neonates [1]. The onset of  NEC  is  not  clinically  specific,  and  the  disease  progresses  rapidly  and  can  be  complicated  by  intestinal perforation  and  necrosis,  causing  death  in  severe  cases [2].  Surviving  children  may  experience  severe  sequelae, including intestinal stricture,  short  bowel  syndrome, dependence on total parenteral nutrition, and neurodevelopmental disorders, leading to both growth and mental retardation. These conditions significantly impact the quality of life in later years [3, 4]. Over the past few years, China has made great progress in perinatal and neonatal  intensive  care,  the  survival  rate  has  increased,  and the  number of premature infants has increased sharply, especially  very  low  birth  weight  (VLBW)  or  extremely premature  infants  at  high  risk  of  NEC,  which  reflects the  importance  of  studying  the  epidemiology  of  contemporary NEC [5, 6].  In  China,  the  incidence  of  NEC was  found  to  be  5.5%  and  7.0%  for  infants  with  birth weights &lt; 1500  g  and  &lt; 1000  g,  respectively,  and  4.8% and 7.6% for infants born at &lt; 32 weeks and &lt; 28 weeks, respectively [7]. Therefore, NEC remains a fulminant disease, necessitating improved prevention, early diagnosis, and more rational management.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEC results from a combination of factors with complex pathophysiology and unclear mechanisms, and individual risk factors remain to be elucidated [8]. Identifying the clinical features that can predict NEC from the many influencing factors is the focus of prevention. Both maternal and neonatal factors may be risk factors for the development of NEC. It has been found that early identification of NEC risk factors, targeted interventions, and timely diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of NEC [9]. Currently, relevant studies on the influencing factors of NEC in Chinese preterm infants have been reported [10-12]. However, the influence of the sample size and the completeness  of  the  children's  data  has  led  to  considerable variability in the results of these studies. As a result, the specific risk factors and protective factors related to NEC remain  unclear.  Although  overseas  studies  on  factors affecting  NEC  in  preterm  infants  have  been  conducted for a long time [13, 14], differences in medical practices, geographic  environments,  and  demographics  between regions may limit the blind generalization of known findings to all areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although  meta-analyses  of  risk  factors  for  neonatal NEC have been reported [15-17], opinions differ on the importance of NEC risk factors. The opinion of a panel of 35 international NEC experts pointed to the ambiguity of risk factors affecting NEC except for gestational age (GA),  birth  weight  (BW)  and  feeding  [18].  Studies  are limited  by  differences  in  population  characteristics  and different  definitions  of  NEC,  leading  to  some  variability in  findings.  This  suggests  that  there  are  modifiable  risk factors that give healthcare professionals the opportunity to intervene to reduce the risk of NEC. Considering that there is no meta-analysis for the factors affecting NEC in Chinese preterm infants, this study used systematic evaluation and meta-analysis by searching the latest literature to  explore  the  major  risk  factors  and  protective  factors affecting  the  occurrence  of  NEC  in  preterm  infants  in China, and to provide a scientific basis for the development of preventive measures for NEC.\n",

      "The  present  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  followed  the  preferred  reporting  items  in  the  systematic review and  meta-analysis (PRISMA)  guidelines  [19]. The  PRISMA  checklist  is  presented  in  S  Table  1.  The databases  of  China  National  Knowledge  Infrastructure (CNKI),  VIP  (Chinese)  and  WanFang  (Chinese)  database, China Biomedical Literature  Database  (CBM), Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed were searched for case -control studies and cohort studies from creation to February 2023. We searched the databases using a combination of subject terms and free words, while references of included studies were hand-searched to supplement  the  relevant  information  obtained.  The  keywords included ('premature infant' OR 'preterm infants 'OR' Neonatal  Prematurity'  OR  'very  preterm  infant'  OR' extremely preterm infants' OR 'Very low birth weight') AND ('necrotizing enterocolitis') AND ('risk factor' OR 'influence  factors')  AND  ('  case -control  studies'  OR 'cohort  study')  AND  ('Chinese'  OR  'China').

      "Three researchers  independently  extracted  data  according to the developed data collection form, and in case of discrepancies,  the  three  discussed  and  approved.  Data extracted  included  author,  publication  year,  study  area, study time, study type, study population, NEC diagnostic criteria, number of cases/control groups, influencing factors  and  Newcastle -Ottawa  Scale  (NOS)  score.  Two researchers independently performed quality assessment using  the  NOS  recommended  by  the  Cochrane  Collaboration Network [21]. In the event of disagreements, group discussions were held to reach a consensus. This scale  includes  3  modules  of  study  population,  comparability  between groups, and outcome evaluation and is divided into 8 entries with a score out of 9. NOS score ≥ 6 is  considered  high-quality  literature.  We  assessed  the methodological  quality  of  our  systematic  reviews  using the  A  Measurement  Tool  to  Assess  Systematic  Reviews 2  (AMSTAR2)  [22].  The  details  of  the  items  in  the AMSTAR-2 tool are shown in S Table 3.\n",

      "We used Stata 14.0 software to perform statistical analysis of the extracted data. Heterogeneity among the studies was analyzed using the χ 2 test (test level α = 0.1), and the Q test was combined with the I 2 statistic to determine heterogeneity.  When I 2 ≥ 50%,  it  indicated  high  heterogeneity  among  the  study  results,  and  a  random-effects model was used. Otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. To assess the stability of the combined results for statistically  significant  risk  factors,  we  conducted  sensitivity  analysis  by  comparing  the  values  obtained  from both  the  fixed-effects  model  and  the  random-effects model. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias, and Egger's  statistical  test  was  used  to  analyze  whether publication  bias  was  statistically  significant.

      "Thirty-eight studies (36 case -control studies [10-12, 2354, 57] and 2 cohort studies [55, 56]) were included, containing a total sample size of 8616 cases, with 2456 cases in  the  intervention group and 6160 cases in the control group,  from  16  different  provinces  in  China.  The  study population  consisted  of  preterm  infants  with  BW  less than 2500 g, GA less than 37 weeks, and Bell staging ≥ II. Diagnostic  criteria  for  NEC  vary.  Twenty-one  studies utilized the revised Bell Subdivision periodical standard of  Practical  Neonatology,  4th  edition,  for  the  diagnosis of NEC in preterm infants [58]. Two studies referred to the revised Bell Subdivision periodical standard of Practical  Neonatology,  5th  edition  [59].  Eight  studies  used the  modified  BELL-NEC  grading  scale  [20].  Two  studies used the revised Bell Subdivision periodical standard [60].  Three  studies  referred  to  Avery's  Diseases  of  the Newborn as the revised Bell marking criteria [61]. One study adopted to the Vermont Oxford Network's revised diagnostic criteria based on Bell staging [62]. One study referred  to  the  U.S.  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of Necrotizing Small Bowel Colitis in Very Low Birth Mass Children [63]. The detailed characteristics are shown in Table 1. Nine studies received a NOS quality assessment score of 6, 15 studies scored 7, 9 studies scored 8, and 5 studies  scored  9.

      "that  MSAF  was  an  independent  risk  factor  for  NEC  in preterm  infants.  The  inhalation  of  amniotic  fluid  contaminated  with  meconium  in  utero  in  preterm  infants can lead to the multiplication of intestinal pathogens and early  infection  [65].  In  addition,  due  to  the  underdevelopment of the gastrointestinal tract, the imperfect barrier function  of  the  intestinal  mucosa,  and  the  high  permeability  of  the  intestinal  wall  in  preterm  infants,  bacteria can easily enter the intestinal tract and cause infections. The application  of  antibiotics  affects  the  distribution  of intestinal  flora,  leading  to  an  increase  in  bacteria  with potential  therapeutic  effects  and  a  decrease  in  normal flora,  which  can  damage  the  intestinal  mucosal  epithelium and lead to NEC [66]. The use of empirical antibiotics  and  the  duration  of  antibiotic  exposure  in  infants are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  NEC  [67].  In  a meta-analysis  of  observational  studies  and  randomized controlled  trials,  prophylactic  antibiotic  use  in  infants was  not  found  to  be  statistically  associated  with  NEC, but with an increased risk [68]. These factors influencing NEC are independent of each other while also influencing and interacting with one other. We also found sepsis to  be  a  risk  factor  for  NEC  in  preterm  infants,  consistent with the findings of Gagliardi et al. [69]. Comparing domestic  and  international  studies  on  sepsis  and  NEC, we found that the OR values of sepsis for NEC reported abroad were mostly above 10 [70], while the OR values\n",
      "\n",
      "reported in China were mostly 3 to 5 [71], and the OR value of our study was 3.91. The fact that there are such obvious differences in such a strong risk factor as sepsis suggests  that  we  should  be  cautious  in  interpreting  the results of epidemiologic studies and medical statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is controversy surrounding whether blood transfusion in preterm infants contributes to an increased incidence of NEC. The present meta-analysis showed that blood transfusion is a risk factor for complications  of  NEC  in  preterm  infants,  while  a  recent meta-analysis showed that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion does not increase the risk of NEC [72]. Blood transfusions,  especially  large  amounts  of  RBC,  can  cause impaired  regulation  of  the  mesenteric  vessels,  leading to increased adhesion and aggregation of RBC and formation of thrombi, resulting in poor blood flow to the intestine  [73].  Whereas,  a  meta-analysis  conducted  by Rai  et  al.  [74]  demonstrated  that  erythrocyte  infusion within 48 h exerted a protective effect on infants with NEC.  Erythropoietin  may  have  a  protective  effect  on the  endothelial  cell  barrier  and  therefore  may  attenuate the development of NEC. This study also found that severe anemia in preterm infants was associated with an increased risk of developing NEC [75]. Analysis of the reasons for this may be related to the fact that anemia decreases  the  expression  of  the  tight  junction  protein ZO-1, increases  the  permeability  of  the  intestinal  barrier,  increases  intestinal  inflammation  by  altering  the function of macrophages,  and  predisposes patients to  NEC.  Patel  et  al.  [75]  reported  that  severe  anemia, rather  than  RBC  transfusion,  was  associated  with  an elevated risk of NEC and suggested that prevention of anemia  may  be  more  beneficial  than  minimizing  RBC transfusions.\n",

      "In this study, RDS, respiratory failure, neonatal asphyxia,  and  mechanical  ventilation  were  all  risk  factors  for  NEC  in  preterm  infants.  Preterm  combined VLBW  infants  are  highly  susceptible  to  asphyxia  after birth due to their underdeveloped respiratory and neurological systems and their inability to perform effective gas exchange  on  their  own.  Infant  asphyxia  can  induce  the body's  defense  reflex  and  redistribute  the  blood  flow  in the body to ensure the oxygen supply to the heart, brain, kidneys  and  other  important  organs,  triggering  strong constriction  of  mesenteric  vessels,  leading  to  ischemia and hypoxia of intestinal epithelial cells and even degeneration  and  necrosis,  resulting  in  NEC  [76].  Neonates with  severe  asphyxia  often  require  mechanical  ventilation, which was shown to be an independent risk factor for NEC in this study, and this is in agreement with the finding by Gagliardi et al. [69]. However, in a Canadian study, mechanical ventilation was shown to be a risk factor for NEC only in sicker infants [77].\n",
      "\n",
      "This meta-analysis confirms that PDA, congenital heart disease, hypoproteinemia, and pneumonia are all risk factors for NEC in preterm infants. Preterm birth in combination  with  PDA  and  congenital  heart  disease  causes inadequate intestinal blood flow, which induces immune responses,  inflammatory  mediators,  and  consequently intestinal  mucosal  injury  and  necrosis,  leading  to  NEC [78].  At  present,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  whether  the presence of PDA or treatment with PDA alters the risk of NEC in infants. In a cohort of infants with PDA aged &lt; 34 weeks, infants with PDA who were not treated with indomethacin had an increased risk of NEC compared with those who were treated [79]. However, in a recent metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [80], it was found that there was no increased risk of NEC in the absence of PDA treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, maternal ICP and GDM were also found to  be  risk  factors  for  NEC  in  preterm  infants,  which  is consistent with the meta-analysis of Lu et al. [16]. Beghetti  et  al.  [81]  concluded  that  high  concentrations of bile acids lead to enhanced contraction of placental villi veins exposed  to  amniotic  fluid,  reduced  blood  supply,  and impaired  intestinal  microcirculation,  resulting  in  intestinal mucosal ischemia and hypoxia and the production of  multiple  free  radicals,  forming  the  pathological  basis for NEC. In GDM patients, the body is in a hyperglycemic state, and the fetus receives nutrients directly from the mother, which can affect the state of intestinal blood flow, lead to intestinal mucosal damage and induce NEC [30].  In  this  study,  the  pooled  OR  of  ICP  for  NEC  was 2.71 with four studies included; the pooled OR for GDM and NEC was 3.08 with only two included studies. Currently, there are fewer studies exploring the relationship between NEC and ICP, GDM, thus caution needs to be taken when making conclusion for the impact of GDM, ICP on NEC based on the observation in this study.\n",

      "## Protect factors for NEC\n",
      "\n",
      "The  safety  of  oral  probiotics  in  preterm  infants  is  currently  controversial,  and  it  is  believed  that  the  optimal strain,  optimal  dose  and  duration  of  probiotics  for  the prevention of NEC have not been determined [82]. Our study  found  that  probiotics  reduced  the  risk  of  NEC, which is consistent with previously published meta-analysis  [83].  Prophylactic  supplementation  with  probiotics increases the deposition and growth of normal flora, enhances  the  barrier  function  of  the  intestinal  mucosa, prevents  the  migration  of  bacteria  or  curative  factors, and  activates  protective  receptors  to  balance  the  intestinal  flora  [84].  The  2020  European  Society  of  Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Nutrition recommends that probiotics such as Bifidobacterium bifidum,\n",
      "\n",
      "when safe  to  do  so,  can  be  given  to  preterm  infants  to reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants [85]. A multicenter  randomized  controlled  study  found  that  early administration  of  Bifidobacterium  bifidum  (BBG-001) did not reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants [86]. The use of probiotics for the prevention of NEC in preterm  infants  is  controversial  and  further  studies  are needed to demonstrate the effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  this  meta-analysis,  prenatal  application  of  glucocorticoids  was  a  protective  factor  for  NEC  in  preterm infants,  which  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  a  previous  meta-analysis  [17].  A  Cochrane  systematic  evaluation  documented  that  antenatal  glucocorticoid  use  in women  at  risk  of  preterm  labor  reduced  the  incidence of  RDS  in  preterm  infants  and  also  reduced  the  risk  of NEC  [87].  It  was  found  that  the  proinflammatory  factors  interleukin-1β  and  interleukin-8  play  an  important role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  NEC,  and  glucocorticoids significantly inhibit the proinflammatory effects of both and promote the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract while reducing the absorption of macromolecules by the intestinal  mucosa  and  avoiding  intestinal  necrosis  [88]. The  clinical  guidelines  for  the  management  of  neonatal necrotizing  small  bowel  colitis,  published  in  China  in 2020, recommend that glucocorticoids should be applied prenatally in mothers at risk of preterm delivery [89].\n",
      "\n",
      "Breastfeeding  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  risk  of NEC. In this study, breastfeeding was a protective factor for NEC in preterm infants, and a review by Nolan et al. [90]  indicated  that  immune  components  in  breast  milk have a protective effect against NEC. A prospective study found that breastfeeding reduced the risk of NEC in preterm infants compared with formula feeding [91]. Breast milk,  with  its  lower  osmolality  compared  to  formula, alleviates  the  osmotic  load  of  food,  relieving  intestinal pressure. In addition, breast milk is rich in secretory IgA, lactoferrin  and  other  antimicrobial  active  substances, which  enhance  the  body's  immune  defense  and  effectively prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract [92].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study had several limitations. First, we only included published literature, and potential publication bias should not be ignored. Second, the quality of the included articles was limited and the heterogeneity among studies was high, and we need to be cautious in interpreting the findings. We only included NEC premature infants hospitalized  in  neonatal  intensive  care  units  (NICUs)  in  China, and  there  was  some  bias  in  the  selection  of  the  study population and region, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. In addition, this study also found that cesarean  section  and  the  use  of  pulmonary  surfactant are protective factors against NEC in premature infants, but due to the limited number of included studies, metaanalysis  was  not  performed  on  these  factors.  Although this  study  only  analyzed  the  factors  influencing  NEC in Chinese preterm infants, it may provide a valuable foundation for future research and interventions to enhance infants' health related to NEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In  summary,  our  study  suggests  that  septicemia,  blood transfusion,  neonatal  asphyxia,  pneumonia,  infection, congenital heart disease, ICP, GDM, RDS, hypoproteinemia,  PDA,  respiratory  failure,  severe  anemia,  antibiotic use  history  and  MSAF  are  risk  factors  for  NEC  in  premature  infants  in  China.  Breastfeeding,  oral  probiotics and prenatal use of glucocorticoids are protective factors. This  is  the  first  meta-analysis  of  the  factors  influencing NEC in preterm infants in China, further expanding our knowledge in this subject area.\n",

      "This study systematically reviewed Chinese literature to identify risk and protective factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. By pooling data from 38 case‑control or cohort studies (total n = 8 616 infants), the authors quantified the association of each factor with NEC using odds ratios (ORs) and evaluated the robustness of the findings through sensitivity and publication‑bias analyses.  \n",

      "- Study design: Systematic review and meta‑analysis of observational case‑control and cohort studies.  \n",
      "- Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, Wanfang, and VIP databases searched from inception to February 2023.  \n",
      "- Selection criteria: Chinese preterm infants (gestational age < 37 weeks, birth weight < 2500 g) with NEC stage II or higher (Bell criteria). Included studies had a control group of preterm infants without NEC and reported quantitative data on potential risk or protective factors. Excluded conference abstracts, case reports, reviews, studies without control groups, incomplete data, or duplicate publications.  \n",
      "- Sample size: 38 eligible studies comprising 2 456 NEC cases and 6 160 controls (total 8 616 infants).  \n",
      "- Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, exposure variables, and outcome data. Quality was assessed with the Newcastle‑Ottawa Scale.  \n",
      "- Statistical analysis: Heterogeneity evaluated with χ² test and I² statistic (α = 0.1). Fixed‑effects model used when I² < 50 %; random‑effects model applied otherwise. Both models were reported for each factor. Sensitivity analysis performed by omitting each study in turn. Publication bias examined with funnel plots and Egger’s test (P < 0.05 considered significant). Analyses conducted in Stata 14.0; significance set at P < 0.05.  \n",

      "Egger’s test identified significant publication bias for septicemia, blood transfusion, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and mechanical ventilation (P < 0.05); other factors showed no significant bias. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the pooled estimates were stable after sequential removal of individual studies, except for a few high‑heterogeneity variables where both fixed and random models were presented.  \n",

      "Conclusions  \n",
      "The meta‑analysis identifies a broad set of maternal, perinatal, and neonatal variables that markedly increase the likelihood of NEC in Chinese preterm infants, while breastfeeding, probiotic supplementation, and antenatal glucocorticoid therapy appear protective. These findings provide evidence‑based targets for clinical prevention strategies and underscore the need for vigilant monitoring of infants exposed to the identified risk factors. This work represents the first comprehensive quantitative synthesis of NEC risk and protective factors specific to the Chinese preterm population.\n",
