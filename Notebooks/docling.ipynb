      "\n",
      "This technical report introduces Docling , an easy to use, self-contained, MITlicensed open-source package for PDF document conversion. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. The code interface allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Converting PDF documents back into a machine-processable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which discards most structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, cloud offerings [3] and most recently, multi-modal vision-language models. As of today, only a handful of open-source tools cover PDF conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Docling , we open-source a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition we developed and presented in the recent past [12, 13, 9]. Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained python library with permissive license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what Docling delivers today:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Converts PDF documents to JSON or Markdown format, stable and lightning fast\n",
      "- Understands detailed page layout, reading order, locates figures and recovers table structures\n",
      "- Extracts metadata from the document, such as title, authors, references and language\n",
      "- Optionally applies OCR, e.g. for scanned PDFs\n",
      "- Can be configured to be optimal for batch-mode (i.e high throughput, low time-to-solution) or interactive mode (compromise on efficiency, low time-to-solution)\n",
      "- Can leverage different accelerators (GPU, MPS, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "To use Docling, you can simply install the docling package from PyPI. Documentation and examples are available in our GitHub repository at github.com/DS4SD/docling. All required model assets 1 are downloaded to a local huggingface datasets cache on first use, unless you choose to pre-install the model assets in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling provides an easy code interface to convert PDF documents from file system, URLs or binary streams, and retrieve the output in either JSON or Markdown format. For convenience, separate methods are offered to convert single documents or batches of documents. A basic usage example is illustrated below. Further examples are available in the Doclign code repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "from docling.document\\_converter import DocumentConverter\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "source = \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01062\" # PDF path or URL converter = DocumentConverter() result = converter.convert_single(source) print(result.render_as_markdown()) # output: \"## DocLayNet: A Large Human -Annotated Dataset for Document -Layout Analysis [...]\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Optionally, you can configure custom pipeline features and runtime options, such as turning on or off features (e.g. OCR, table structure recognition), enforcing limits on the input document size, and defining the budget of CPU threads. Advanced usage examples and options are documented in the README file. Docling also provides a Dockerfile to demonstrate how to install and run it inside a container.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 Processing pipeline\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling implements a linear pipeline of operations, which execute sequentially on each given document (see Fig. 1). Each document is first parsed by a PDF backend, which retrieves the programmatic text tokens, consisting of string content and its coordinates on the page, and also renders a bitmap image of each page to support downstream operations. Then, the standard model pipeline applies a sequence of AI models independently on every page in the document to extract features and content, such as layout and table structures. Finally, the results from all pages are aggregated and passed through a post-processing stage, which augments metadata, detects the document language, infers reading-order and eventually assembles a typed document object which can be serialized to JSON or Markdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1 PDF backends\n",
      "\n",
      "Two basic requirements to process PDF documents in our pipeline are a) to retrieve all text content and their geometric coordinates on each page and b) to render the visual representation of each page as it would appear in a PDF viewer. Both these requirements are encapsulated in Docling's PDF backend interface. While there are several open-source PDF parsing libraries available for python, we faced major obstacles with all of them for different reasons, among which were restrictive\n",
      "\n",
      "1 see huggingface.co/ds4sd/docling-models/\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: Sketch of Docling's default processing pipeline. The inner part of the model pipeline is easily customizable and extensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "licensing (e.g. pymupdf [7]), poor speed or unrecoverable quality issues, such as merged text cells across far-apart text tokens or table columns (pypdfium, PyPDF) [15, 14].\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore decided to provide multiple backend choices, and additionally open-source a custombuilt PDF parser, which is based on the low-level qpdf [4] library. It is made available in a separate package named docling-parse and powers the default PDF backend in Docling. As an alternative, we provide a PDF backend relying on pypdfium , which may be a safe backup choice in certain cases, e.g. if issues are seen with particular font encodings.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.2 AI models\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of Docling, we initially release two highly capable AI models to the open-source community, which have been developed and published recently by our team. The first model is a layout analysis model, an accurate object-detector for page elements [13]. The second model is TableFormer [12, 9], a state-of-the-art table structure recognition model. We provide the pre-trained weights (hosted on huggingface) and a separate package for the inference code as docling-ibm-models . Both models are also powering the open-access deepsearch-experience, our cloud-native service for knowledge exploration tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Layout Analysis Model\n",
      "\n",
      "Our layout analysis model is an object-detector which predicts the bounding-boxes and classes of various elements on the image of a given page. Its architecture is derived from RT-DETR [16] and re-trained on DocLayNet [13], our popular human-annotated dataset for document-layout analysis, among other proprietary datasets. For inference, our implementation relies on the onnxruntime [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Docling pipeline feeds page images at 72 dpi resolution, which can be processed on a single CPU with sub-second latency. All predicted bounding-box proposals for document elements are post-processed to remove overlapping proposals based on confidence and size, and then intersected with the text tokens in the PDF to group them into meaningful and complete units such as paragraphs, section titles, list items, captions, figures or tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Table Structure Recognition\n",
      "\n",
      "The TableFormer model [12], first published in 2022 and since refined with a custom structure token language [9], is a vision-transformer model for table structure recovery. It can predict the logical row and column structure of a given table based on an input image, and determine which table cells belong to column headers, row headers or the table body. Compared to earlier approaches, TableFormer handles many characteristics of tables, such as partial or no borderlines, empty cells, rows or columns, cell spans and hierarchy both on column-heading or row-heading level, tables with inconsistent indentation or alignment and other complexities. For inference, our implementation relies on PyTorch [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Docling pipeline feeds all table objects detected in the layout analysis to the TableFormer model, by providing an image-crop of the table and the included text cells. TableFormer structure predictions are matched back to the PDF cells in post-processing to avoid expensive re-transcription text in the table image. Typical tables require between 2 and 6 seconds to be processed on a standard CPU, strongly depending on the amount of included table cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "## OCR\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling provides optional support for OCR, for example to cover scanned PDFs or content in bitmaps images embedded on a page. In our initial release, we rely on EasyOCR [1], a popular thirdparty OCR library with support for many languages. Docling, by default, feeds a high-resolution page image (216 dpi) to the OCR engine, to allow capturing small print detail in decent quality. While EasyOCR delivers reasonable transcription quality, we observe that it runs fairly slow on CPU (upwards of 30 seconds per page).\n",
      "\n",
      "We are actively seeking collaboration from the open-source community to extend Docling with additional OCR backends and speed improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.3 Assembly\n",
      "\n",
      "In the final pipeline stage, Docling assembles all prediction results produced on each page into a well-defined datatype that encapsulates a converted document, as defined in the auxiliary package docling-core . The generated document object is passed through a post-processing model which leverages several algorithms to augment features, such as detection of the document language, correcting the reading order, matching figures with captions and labelling metadata such as title, authors and references. The final output can then be serialized to JSON or transformed into a Markdown representation at the users request.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.4 Extensibility\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling provides a straight-forward interface to extend its capabilities, namely the model pipeline. A model pipeline constitutes the central part in the processing, following initial document parsing and preceding output assembly, and can be fully customized by sub-classing from an abstract baseclass ( BaseModelPipeline ) or cloning the default model pipeline. This effectively allows to fully customize the chain of models, add or replace models, and introduce additional pipeline configuration parameters. To use a custom model pipeline, the custom pipeline class to instantiate can be provided as an argument to the main document conversion methods. We invite everyone in the community to propose additional or alternative models and improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementations of model classes must satisfy the python Callable interface. The \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method must accept an iterator over page objects, and produce another iterator over the page objects which were augmented with the additional features predicted by the model, by extending the provided PagePredictions data model accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4 Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we establish some reference numbers for the processing speed of Docling and the resource budget it requires. All tests in this section are run with default options on our standard test set distributed with Docling, which consists of three papers from arXiv and two IBM Redbooks, with a total of 225 pages. Measurements were taken using both available PDF backends on two different hardware systems: one MacBook Pro M3 Max, and one bare-metal server running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on an Intel Xeon E5-2690 CPU. For reproducibility, we fixed the thread budget (through setting OMP NUM THREADS environment variable ) once to 4 (Docling default) and once to 16 (equal to full core count on the test hardware). All results are shown in Table 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to run Docling in very low-resource environments, please consider configuring the pypdfium backend. While it is faster and more memory efficient than the default docling-parse backend, it will come at the expense of worse quality results, especially in table structure recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Establishing GPU acceleration support for the AI models is currently work-in-progress and largely untested, but may work implicitly when CUDA is available and discovered by the onnxruntime and\n",
      "\n",
      "torch runtimes backing the Docling pipeline. We will deliver updates on this topic at in a future version of this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 1: Runtime characteristics of Docling with the standard model pipeline and settings, on our test dataset of 225 pages, on two different systems. OCR is disabled. We show the time-to-solution (TTS), computed throughput in pages per second, and the peak memory used (resident set size) for both the Docling-native PDF backend and for the pypdfium backend, using 4 and 16 threads.\n",

      "## 5 Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the high-quality, richly structured document conversion achieved by Docling, its output qualifies for numerous downstream applications. For example, Docling can provide a base for detailed enterprise document search, passage retrieval or classification use-cases, or support knowledge extraction pipelines, allowing specific treatment of different structures in the document, such as tables, figures, section structure or references. For popular generative AI application patterns, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we provide quackling , an open-source package which capitalizes on Docling's feature-rich document output to enable document-native optimized vector embedding and chunking. It plugs in seamlessly with LLM frameworks such as LlamaIndex [8]. Since Docling is fast, stable and cheap to run, it also makes for an excellent choice to build document-derived datasets. With its powerful table structure recognition, it provides significant benefit to automated knowledge-base construction [11, 10]. Docling is also integrated within the open IBM data prep kit [6], which implements scalable data transforms to build large-scale multi-modal training datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6 Future work and contributions\n",
      "\n",
      "Docling is designed to allow easy extension of the model library and pipelines. In the future, we plan to extend Docling with several more models, such as a figure-classifier model, an equationrecognition model, a code-recognition model and more. This will help improve the quality of conversion for specific types of content, as well as augment extracted document metadata with additional information. Further investment into testing and optimizing GPU acceleration as well as improving the Docling-native PDF backend are on our roadmap, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We encourage everyone to propose or implement additional features and models, and will gladly take your inputs and contributions under review . The codebase of Docling is open for use and contribution, under the MIT license agreement and in alignment with our contributing guidelines included in the Docling repository. If you use Docling in your projects, please consider citing this technical report.\n",

      "Despite the substantial improvements achieved with machine-learning (ML) approaches and deep neural networks in recent years, document conversion remains a challenging problem, as demonstrated by the numerous public competitions held on this topic [1-4]. The challenge originates from the huge variability in PDF documents regarding layout, language and formats (scanned, programmatic or a combination of both). Engineering a single ML model that can be applied on all types of documents and provides high-quality layout segmentation remains to this day extremely challenging [5]. To highlight the variability in document layouts, we show a few example documents from the DocLayNet dataset in Figure 1. Figure 2: Title page of the DocLayNet paper (arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01062) - left PDF, right rendered Markdown. If recognized, metadata such as authors are appearing first under the title. Text content inside figures is currently dropped, the caption is retained and linked to the figure in the JSON representation (not shown).\n",

      "to avoid this at any cost in order to have clear, unbiased baseline numbers for human document-layout annotation. Third, we introduced the feature of snapping boxes around text segments to obtain a pixel-accurate annotation and again reduce time and effort. The CCS annotation tool automatically shrinks every user-drawn box to the minimum bounding-box around the enclosed text-cells for all purely text-based segments, which excludes only Table and Picture . For the latter, we instructed annotation staff to minimise inclusion of surrounding whitespace while including all graphical lines. A downside of snapping boxes to enclosed text cells is that some wrongly parsed PDF pages cannot be annotated correctly and need to be skipped. Fourth, we established a way to flag pages as rejected for cases where no valid annotation according to the label guidelines could be achieved. Example cases for this would be PDF pages that render incorrectly or contain layouts that are impossible to capture with non-overlapping rectangles. Such rejected pages are not contained in the final dataset. With all these measures in place, experienced annotation staff managed to annotate a single page in a typical timeframe of 20s to 60s, depending on its complexity.\n",

      "The primary goal of DocLayNet is to obtain high-quality ML models capable of accurate document-layout analysis on a wide variety of challenging layouts. As discussed in Section 2, object detection models are currently the easiest to use, due to the standardisation of ground-truth data in COCO format [16] and the availability of general frameworks such as detectron2 [17]. Furthermore, baseline numbers in PubLayNet and DocBank were obtained using standard object detection models such as Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN. As such, we will relate to these object detection methods in this\n",

      "In this section, we will present several aspects related to the performance of object detection models on DocLayNet. Similarly as in PubLayNet, we will evaluate the quality of their predictions using mean average precision (mAP) with 10 overlaps that range from 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05 (mAP@0.5-0.95). These scores are computed by leveraging the evaluation code provided by the COCO API [16].\n",

      "\n",
      "In Table 2, we present baseline experiments (given in mAP) on Mask R-CNN [12], Faster R-CNN [11], and YOLOv5 [13]. Both training and evaluation were performed on RGB images with dimensions of 1025 Ã 1025 pixels. For training, we only used one annotation in case of redundantly annotated pages. As one can observe, the variation in mAP between the models is rather low, but overall between 6 and 10% lower than the mAP computed from the pairwise human annotations on triple-annotated pages. This gives a good indication that the DocLayNet dataset poses a worthwhile challenge for the research community to close the gap between human recognition and ML approaches. It is interesting to see that Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN produce very comparable mAP scores, indicating that pixel-based image segmentation derived from bounding-boxes does not help to obtain better predictions. On the other hand, the more recent Yolov5x model does very well and even out-performs humans on selected labels such as Text , Table and Picture . This is not entirely surprising, as Text , Table and Picture are abundant and the most visually distinctive in a document.\n",

However, studies with large samples on the factors of NEC in China have not been reported. This meta-analysis aims to systematically review the literature to explore the influencing factors of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants in China and provide a reference for the prevention of NEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Wanfang and VIP databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2023. We used Stata14.0 software to perform the systematic review and meta-analysis. We used fixed or random effects models with combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and quality was evaluated using the Newcastle -Ottawa Scale (NOS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Results The total sample was 8616 cases, including 2456 cases in the intervention group and 6160 cases in the control group. It was found that 16 risk factors and 3 protective factors were related to necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Septicemia (OR = 3.91), blood transfusion (OR = 2.41), neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.46), pneumonia (OR = 6.17), infection (OR = 5.99), congenital heart disease (OR = 4.80), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) (OR = 2.71 ) , mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.44), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR = 3.08), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (OR = 3.28), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 2.80), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (OR = 3.10), respiratory failure (OR = 7.51), severe anemia (OR = 2.86), history of antibiotic use (OR = 2.12), and meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) (OR = 3.14) were risk factors for NEC in preterm infants in China. Breastfeeding (OR = 0.31), oral probiotics (OR = 0.36), and prenatal use of glucocorticoids (OR = 0.38) were protective factors for NEC in preterm infants.\n",

      "Conclusions Septicemia, blood transfusion, neonatal asphyxia, pneumonia, infection, congenital heart disease, ICP , GDM, RDS, hypoproteinemia, PDA, respiratory failure, severe anemia, history of antibiotic use and MSAF will increase the risk of NEC in premature infants, whereas breastfeeding, oral probiotics and prenatal use of glucocorticoids reduce the risk. Due to the quantity and quality of the included literature, the above findings need to be further validated by more high-quality studies.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in neonates [1]. The onset of  NEC  is  not  clinically  specific,  and  the  disease  progresses  rapidly  and  can  be  complicated  by  intestinal perforation  and  necrosis,  causing  death  in  severe  cases [2].  Surviving  children  may  experience  severe  sequelae, including intestinal stricture,  short  bowel  syndrome, dependence on total parenteral nutrition, and neurodevelopmental disorders, leading to both growth and mental retardation. These conditions significantly impact the quality of life in later years [3, 4]. Over the past few years, China has made great progress in perinatal and neonatal  intensive  care,  the  survival  rate  has  increased,  and the  number of premature infants has increased sharply, especially  very  low  birth  weight  (VLBW)  or  extremely premature  infants  at  high  risk  of  NEC,  which  reflects the  importance  of  studying  the  epidemiology  of  contemporary NEC [5, 6].  In  China,  the  incidence  of  NEC was  found  to  be  5.5%  and  7.0%  for  infants  with  birth weights &lt; 1500  g  and  &lt; 1000  g,  respectively,  and  4.8% and 7.6% for infants born at &lt; 32 weeks and &lt; 28 weeks, respectively [7]. Therefore, NEC remains a fulminant disease, necessitating improved prevention, early diagnosis, and more rational management.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEC results from a combination of factors with complex pathophysiology and unclear mechanisms, and individual risk factors remain to be elucidated [8]. Identifying the clinical features that can predict NEC from the many influencing factors is the focus of prevention. Both maternal and neonatal factors may be risk factors for the development of NEC. It has been found that early identification of NEC risk factors, targeted interventions, and timely diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of NEC [9]. Currently, relevant studies on the influencing factors of NEC in Chinese preterm infants have been reported [10-12]. However, the influence of the sample size and the completeness  of  the  children's  data  has  led  to  considerable variability in the results of these studies. As a result, the specific risk factors and protective factors related to NEC remain  unclear.  Although  overseas  studies  on  factors affecting  NEC  in  preterm  infants  have  been  conducted for a long time [13, 14], differences in medical practices, geographic  environments,  and  demographics  between regions may limit the blind generalization of known findings to all areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although  meta-analyses  of  risk  factors  for  neonatal NEC have been reported [15-17], opinions differ on the importance of NEC risk factors. The opinion of a panel of 35 international NEC experts pointed to the ambiguity of risk factors affecting NEC except for gestational age (GA),  birth  weight  (BW)  and  feeding  [18].  Studies  are limited  by  differences  in  population  characteristics  and different  definitions  of  NEC,  leading  to  some  variability in  findings.  This  suggests  that  there  are  modifiable  risk factors that give healthcare professionals the opportunity to intervene to reduce the risk of NEC. Considering that there is no meta-analysis for the factors affecting NEC in Chinese preterm infants, this study used systematic evaluation and meta-analysis by searching the latest literature to  explore  the  major  risk  factors  and  protective  factors affecting  the  occurrence  of  NEC  in  preterm  infants  in China, and to provide a scientific basis for the development of preventive measures for NEC.\n",

Data extracted  included  author,  publication  year,  study  area, study time, study type, study population, NEC diagnostic criteria, number of cases/control groups, influencing factors  and  Newcastle -Ottawa  Scale  (NOS)  score.  Two researchers independently performed quality assessment using  the  NOS  recommended  by  the  Cochrane  Collaboration Network [21]. In the event of disagreements, group discussions were held to reach a consensus. This scale  includes  3  modules  of  study  population,  comparability  between groups, and outcome evaluation and is divided into 8 entries with a score out of 9. NOS score â¥ 6 is  considered  high-quality  literature.  We  assessed  the methodological  quality  of  our  systematic  reviews  using the  A  Measurement  Tool  to  Assess  Systematic  Reviews 2  (AMSTAR2)  [22].

When I 2 â¥ 50%,  it  indicated  high  heterogeneity  among  the  study  results,  and  a  random-effects model was used. Otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. To assess the stability of the combined results for statistically  significant  risk  factors,  we  conducted  sensitivity  analysis  by  comparing  the  values  obtained  from both  the  fixed-effects  model  and  the  random-effects model. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias, and Egger's  statistical  test  was  used  to  analyze  whether publication  bias  was  statistically  significant.

The  study population  consisted  of  preterm  infants  with  BW  less than 2500 g, GA less than 37 weeks, and Bell staging â¥ II. Diagnostic  criteria  for  NEC  vary.  Twenty-one  studies utilized the revised Bell Subdivision periodical standard of  Practical  Neonatology,  4th  edition,  for  the  diagnosis of NEC in preterm infants [58]. Two studies referred to the revised Bell Subdivision periodical standard of Practical  Neonatology,  5th  edition  [59].  Eight  studies  used the  modified  BELL-NEC  grading  scale  [20].  Two  studies used the revised Bell Subdivision periodical standard [60].  Three  studies  referred  to  Avery's  Diseases  of  the Newborn as the revised Bell marking criteria [61]. One study adopted to the Vermont Oxford Network's revised diagnostic criteria based on Bell staging [62]. One study referred  to  the  U.S.  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of Necrotizing Small Bowel Colitis in Very Low Birth Mass Children [63]. The detailed characteristics are shown in TableÂ 1. Nine studies received a NOS quality assessment score of 6, 15 studies scored 7, 9 studies scored 8, and 5 studies  scored  9.

      "that  MSAF  was  an  independent  risk  factor  for  NEC  in preterm  infants.  The  inhalation  of  amniotic  fluid  contaminated  with  meconium  in  utero  in  preterm  infants can lead to the multiplication of intestinal pathogens and early  infection  [65].  In  addition,  due  to  the  underdevelopment of the gastrointestinal tract, the imperfect barrier function  of  the  intestinal  mucosa,  and  the  high  permeability  of  the  intestinal  wall  in  preterm  infants,  bacteria can easily enter the intestinal tract and cause infections. The application  of  antibiotics  affects  the  distribution  of intestinal  flora,  leading  to  an  increase  in  bacteria  with potential  therapeutic  effects  and  a  decrease  in  normal flora,  which  can  damage  the  intestinal  mucosal  epithelium and lead to NEC [66]. The use of empirical antibiotics  and  the  duration  of  antibiotic  exposure  in  infants are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  NEC  [67].  In  a meta-analysis  of  observational  studies  and  randomized controlled  trials,  prophylactic  antibiotic  use  in  infants was  not  found  to  be  statistically  associated  with  NEC, but with an increased risk [68]. These factors influencing NEC are independent of each other while also influencing and interacting with one other. We also found sepsis to  be  a  risk  factor  for  NEC  in  preterm  infants,  consistent with the findings of Gagliardi etÂ al. [69]. Comparing domestic  and  international  studies  on  sepsis  and  NEC, we found that the OR values of sepsis for NEC reported abroad were mostly above 10 [70], while the OR values\n",
      "\n",
      "reported in China were mostly 3 to 5 [71], and the OR value of our study was 3.91. The fact that there are such obvious differences in such a strong risk factor as sepsis suggests  that  we  should  be  cautious  in  interpreting  the results of epidemiologic studies and medical statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is controversy surrounding whether blood transfusion in preterm infants contributes to an increased incidence of NEC. The present meta-analysis showed that blood transfusion is a risk factor for complications  of  NEC  in  preterm  infants,  while  a  recent meta-analysis showed that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion does not increase the risk of NEC [72]. Blood transfusions,  especially  large  amounts  of  RBC,  can  cause impaired  regulation  of  the  mesenteric  vessels,  leading to increased adhesion and aggregation of RBC and formation of thrombi, resulting in poor blood flow to the intestine  [73].  Whereas,  a  meta-analysis  conducted  by Rai  etÂ  al.  [74]  demonstrated  that  erythrocyte  infusion within 48 h exerted a protective effect on infants with NEC.  Erythropoietin  may  have  a  protective  effect  on the  endothelial  cell  barrier  and  therefore  may  attenuate the development of NEC. This study also found that severe anemia in preterm infants was associated with an increased risk of developing NEC [75]. Analysis of the reasons for this may be related to the fact that anemia decreases  the  expression  of  the  tight  junction  protein ZO-1, increases  the  permeability  of  the  intestinal  barrier,  increases  intestinal  inflammation  by  altering  the function of macrophages,  and  predisposes patients to  NEC.  Patel  etÂ  al.  [75]  reported  that  severe  anemia, rather  than  RBC  transfusion,  was  associated  with  an elevated risk of NEC and suggested that prevention of anemia  may  be  more  beneficial  than  minimizing  RBC transfusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, RDS, respiratory failure, neonatal asphyxia,  and  mechanical  ventilation  were  all  risk  factors  for  NEC  in  preterm  infants.  Preterm  combined VLBW  infants  are  highly  susceptible  to  asphyxia  after birth due to their underdeveloped respiratory and neurological systems and their inability to perform effective gas exchange  on  their  own.  Infant  asphyxia  can  induce  the body's  defense  reflex  and  redistribute  the  blood  flow  in the body to ensure the oxygen supply to the heart, brain, kidneys  and  other  important  organs,  triggering  strong constriction  of  mesenteric  vessels,  leading  to  ischemia and hypoxia of intestinal epithelial cells and even degeneration  and  necrosis,  resulting  in  NEC  [76].  Neonates with  severe  asphyxia  often  require  mechanical  ventilation, which was shown to be an independent risk factor for NEC in this study, and this is in agreement with the finding by Gagliardi etÂ al. [69]. However, in a Canadian study, mechanical ventilation was shown to be a risk factor for NEC only in sicker infants [77].\n",
      "\n",
      "This meta-analysis confirms that PDA, congenital heart disease, hypoproteinemia, and pneumonia are all risk factors for NEC in preterm infants. Preterm birth in combination  with  PDA  and  congenital  heart  disease  causes inadequate intestinal blood flow, which induces immune responses,  inflammatory  mediators,  and  consequently intestinal  mucosal  injury  and  necrosis,  leading  to  NEC [78].  At  present,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  whether  the presence of PDA or treatment with PDA alters the risk of NEC in infants. In a cohort of infants with PDA aged &lt; 34 weeks, infants with PDA who were not treated with indomethacin had an increased risk of NEC compared with those who were treated [79]. However, in a recent metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [80], it was found that there was no increased risk of NEC in the absence of PDA treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, maternal ICP and GDM were also found to  be  risk  factors  for  NEC  in  preterm  infants,  which  is consistent with the meta-analysis of Lu etÂ al. [16]. Beghetti  etÂ  al.  [81]  concluded  that  high  concentrations of bile acids lead to enhanced contraction of placental villi veins exposed  to  amniotic  fluid,  reduced  blood  supply,  and impaired  intestinal  microcirculation,  resulting  in  intestinal mucosal ischemia and hypoxia and the production of  multiple  free  radicals,  forming  the  pathological  basis for NEC. In GDM patients, the body is in a hyperglycemic state, and the fetus receives nutrients directly from the mother, which can affect the state of intestinal blood flow, lead to intestinal mucosal damage and induce NEC [30].  In  this  study,  the  pooled  OR  of  ICP  for  NEC  was 2.71 with four studies included; the pooled OR for GDM and NEC was 3.08 with only two included studies. Currently, there are fewer studies exploring the relationship between NEC and ICP, GDM, thus caution needs to be taken when making conclusion for the impact of GDM, ICP on NEC based on the observation in this study.\n",

      "The  safety  of  oral  probiotics  in  preterm  infants  is  currently  controversial,  and  it  is  believed  that  the  optimal strain,  optimal  dose  and  duration  of  probiotics  for  the prevention of NEC have not been determined [82]. Our study  found  that  probiotics  reduced  the  risk  of  NEC, which is consistent with previously published meta-analysis  [83].  Prophylactic  supplementation  with  probiotics increases the deposition and growth of normal flora, enhances  the  barrier  function  of  the  intestinal  mucosa, prevents  the  migration  of  bacteria  or  curative  factors, and  activates  protective  receptors  to  balance  the  intestinal  flora  [84].  The  2020  European  Society  of  Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Nutrition recommends that probiotics such as Bifidobacterium bifidum,\n",
      "\n",
      "when safe  to  do  so,  can  be  given  to  preterm  infants  to reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants [85]. A multicenter  randomized  controlled  study  found  that  early administration  of  Bifidobacterium  bifidum  (BBG-001) did not reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants [86]. The use of probiotics for the prevention of NEC in preterm  infants  is  controversial  and  further  studies  are needed to demonstrate the effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  this  meta-analysis,  prenatal  application  of  glucocorticoids  was  a  protective  factor  for  NEC  in  preterm infants,  which  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  a  previous  meta-analysis  [17].  A  Cochrane  systematic  evaluation  documented  that  antenatal  glucocorticoid  use  in women  at  risk  of  preterm  labor  reduced  the  incidence of  RDS  in  preterm  infants  and  also  reduced  the  risk  of NEC  [87].  It  was  found  that  the  proinflammatory  factors  interleukin-1Î²  and  interleukin-8  play  an  important role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  NEC,  and  glucocorticoids significantly inhibit the proinflammatory effects of both and promote the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract while reducing the absorption of macromolecules by the intestinal  mucosa  and  avoiding  intestinal  necrosis  [88]. The  clinical  guidelines  for  the  management  of  neonatal necrotizing  small  bowel  colitis,  published  in  China  in 2020, recommend that glucocorticoids should be applied prenatally in mothers at risk of preterm delivery [89].\n",
      "\n",
      "Breastfeeding  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  risk  of NEC. In this study, breastfeeding was a protective factor for NEC in preterm infants, and a review by Nolan etÂ al. [90]  indicated  that  immune  components  in  breast  milk have a protective effect against NEC. A prospective study found that breastfeeding reduced the risk of NEC in preterm infants compared with formula feeding [91]. Breast milk,  with  its  lower  osmolality  compared  to  formula, alleviates  the  osmotic  load  of  food,  relieving  intestinal pressure. In addition, breast milk is rich in secretory IgA, lactoferrin  and  other  antimicrobial  active  substances, which  enhance  the  body's  immune  defense  and  effectively prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract [92].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study had several limitations. First, we only included published literature, and potential publication bias should not be ignored. Second, the quality of the included articles was limited and the heterogeneity among studies was high, and we need to be cautious in interpreting the findings. We only included NEC premature infants hospitalized  in  neonatal  intensive  care  units  (NICUs)  in  China, and  there  was  some  bias  in  the  selection  of  the  study population and region, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. In addition, this study also found that cesarean  section  and  the  use  of  pulmonary  surfactant are protective factors against NEC in premature infants, but due to the limited number of included studies, metaanalysis  was  not  performed  on  these  factors.  Although this  study  only  analyzed  the  factors  influencing  NEC in Chinese preterm infants, it may provide a valuable foundation for future research and interventions to enhance infants' health related to NEC.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",

      "In  summary,  our  study  suggests  that  septicemia,  blood transfusion,  neonatal  asphyxia,  pneumonia,  infection, congenital heart disease, ICP, GDM, RDS, hypoproteinemia,  PDA,  respiratory  failure,  severe  anemia,  antibiotic use  history  and  MSAF  are  risk  factors  for  NEC  in  premature  infants  in  China.  Breastfeeding,  oral  probiotics and prenatal use of glucocorticoids are protective factors. This  is  the  first  meta-analysis  of  the  factors  influencing NEC in preterm infants in China, further expanding our knowledge in this subject area.\n",

      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), yet the global incidence of NEC has not been systematically evaluated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies reporting the incidence of NEC in infants with Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW).\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods: The databases searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and grey literature. Eligible studies were cohort or population-based studies of newborns including registry data reporting incidence of NEC. Incidence were pooled using Random Effect Models (REM), in the presence of substantial heterogeneity. Additional, bias adjusted Quality Effect Models (QEM) were used to get sensitivity estimates. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Funnel plots as appropriate for ratio measures were used to assess publication bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: A systematic and comprehensive search of databases identified 27 cohort studies reporting the incidence of NEC. The number of neonate included in these studies was 574,692. Of this 39,965 developed NEC. There were substantial heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 100%). The pooled estimate of NEC based on REM was 7.0% (95% CI: 6.0 -8.0%). QEM based estimate (6.0%; 95% CI: 4.0 -9.0%) were also similar. Funnel plots showed no evidence of publication bias. Although, NEC estimates are similar across various regions, some variation between high and low income countries were noted. Meta regression findings showed a statistically significant increase of NEC over time, quantified by the publication year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: Seven out of 100 of all VLBW infants in NICU are likely to develop NEC. However, there were considerable heterogeneity between studies. High quality studies assessing incidence of NEC along with associated risk factors are warranted.\n",

      "## Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Last three decades have witnessed great improvements in the neonatal intensive care, in particular, with the introduction of surfactant therapy and the subsequent improvement in the care of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) that reduced the mortality among preterm newborns [1]. With better survival of premature babies, Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) became more common and its burden became more prominent [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple population-based studies, some based on large cohort studies, have reported the incidence of NEC to vary from 2 to 13% in preterm and Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants [2 -6]. The variation in the incidence were attributed to differences in the risk factor profiles as well as differing population at risk, detection rate and inclusion and exclusion criteria. There is no pooled estimate of the incidence of NEC worldwide. Furthermore, there is no incidence data from some regions such as North Africa, the Middle East or the Arab Gulf region, apart from a single study from the UAE [7].\n",
      "\n",
      "With the continuing improvement in survival of preterm newborns, the modifiable risk factors of NEC need to be studies and made use of in developing appropriate interventions to reduce the incidence and impact of NEC. In this context, clinicians and researchers have attempted to identify the factors associated with risk and prognosis of NEC. It was reported as early as the 1980 ' s, that there exist an association between rapid advancement of feeding and the onset of NEC [8]. Subsequent reports showed preterm birth [9, 10], small birth weight [9 -11] and race [11] were also to be important risk factors. Contemporary reports confirm these initial reports and expand the list to include a few more. More recent studies have shown that preterm birth [3, 12]. low birth weight [2, 12], rapid advancement of feeding, race and ethnicity, use of glucocorticosteriods [2], maternal infection [13], indomethacin therapy [14], congenital pneumonia [14], meconium aspiration [15], asphyxia [15], blood transfusion [15] and hypotension within the first week of life [16] are also potential contributing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This study aims to systematically review the incidence reported from different parts of the world to synthesize a global incidence of confirmed NEC in VLBW infants. The study also aims to explore the regional variability as well as other potential factors that can explain variability in the incidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRIS MA) served as the guide in collating and reporting this review [17].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Eligibility criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "Eligible studies included cohort or population-based studies of newborns including registry data. Both prospective and retrospective studies were included. Studies reporting the number, frequency or incidence of confirmed NEC in preterm infants or VLBW infants along with appropriate denominator were included. Studies that reported data on subgroups of infants with specific exposures such as congenital heart disease, perinatal infections, preterm rupture of membrane, or sepsis were excluded when the incidence could not be extracted. Studies with unclear case definitions of NEC were also excluded. Randomized controlled trials had strict selection criteria therefore including them would have caused selection bias and reduced the external validity of our pooled estimate. Hence, experimental studies that were assessing the effect of an intervention on a selected group of neonates were excluded. Case series where there were no denominator data to compute the incidence were also excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incidence is used as opposed to prevalence because of the natural history of NEC and its short duration of disease. It is envisaged that findings form this study would provide clinically important baseline data as the starting point for studies that aim to reduce the incidence of NEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Population and outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "The VLBW infants formed the population of this study and the outcome of was the incidence of NEC stage II or above according to Bells criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Search data bases\n",
      "\n",
      "The database search was started in September 2018 and last updated in December 2019. The databases searched were PUBMED, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library. Additional databases searched included: African Index Medicus Database, Latin America and Caribbean Center of Health Science International, Open Grey, IndMED, KoreaMED, Virtual Health Library, National Library of Australia and Social Care Online.. Further manual search included looking for relevant studies in the reference lists of the included papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Search strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "The search strategy was developed by the authors to include a comprehensive database search using broader search terms such as: ' Enterocolitis, Necrotizing ' , ' Epidemiology ' , ' Incidence ' , ' Cohort Studies ' , and ' population-Based studies ' , ' cohort studies ' , ' epidemiological data ' , ' prematurity ' , ' Very low birth weight ' , ' clinical study ' , ' cohort analysis ' , and '' human ' . Additional MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) term based search complemented the above search. When appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "using the above terms with a combination of ' and ' and ' or ' in accordance with search engine specifications were carried out. The search string used for PUBMED is given in Supplementary file S1 as an illustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Study selection\n",
      "\n",
      "Two review authors (AA and NI) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all citations retrieved by the search for relevance against the inclusion criteria. Then the full-text versions of studies considered potentially eligible were retrieved. The same two authors independently assessed the full papers for eligibility, with disagreements resolved through input of the third author. The duplicate records and those not eligible were eliminated and a PRISMA flow chart was created to depict the study selection process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data extraction\n",
      "\n",
      "Data form the eligible studies were extracted and collated on to data tables. Name of the authors, year of publication, data on the time period covered by the study, location of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study (Table 1), the reported population at risk and whether it was VLBW infants or preterm infants, case definition, incidence or number on NEC cases and size of population at risk (Table 2) were collected. The data extraction process was performed by AA and checked by NI. Any discrepancies is resolved by discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk of Bias assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "All the included studies were assessed for internal and external validity using the criteria put forward by Hoy et al. that were specific for prevalence and incidence studies (Fig. 1). This tool was developed based on key domains they identified to be important in assessing the risk of bias in incidence and prevalence studies. The tool was subsequently validated and found to have good validity [30].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data synthesis\n",
      "\n",
      "Pooling the incidence estimates was done after arcsine transformations of the data as it has been shown to stabilize variance and reduce bias [31]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q test and Higgin ' s I 2 value. Smaller p values and I 2 &gt; 50% were indicative of significant heterogeneity [32, 33]. As Cochrane guidelines suggest use of Random Effect Models (REM) when significant heterogeneity is encountered [34] we employed REM models estimates to arrive at the main conclusion. Further, bias adjusted Quality Effect Models (QEM) [35] were used to obtain sensitivity estimates to check the robustness of the REM estimates. Quality scores obtained using Hoy ' s criteria were used in fitting the QEM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forest plots were used to display the incidence of NEC with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We used Hunter plots to assess the publication bias as Hunter et al. have shown the classical funnel plot to be inappropriate for proportion studies such as prevalence or incidence [36].\n",
      "\n",
      "A-priori planned meta-regression was performed to evaluate if the publication year has any impact on the variability of the incidence and as a possible cause of heterogeneity. This was also thought to be important to understand if the long term trend in incidence of NEC to see if they are on a rise or decline. Further subgroup analysis by region based on income category of the countries provided by World Bank and population at risk (VLBW or extremely premature) was also carried out [37]. This sub-group analysis was not an a-priori decision but an attempt to explain the variability in NEC due to substantial heterogeneity. Groups consisted of high income countries (HIC) and low middle-income countries (LMIC).\n",
      "\n",
      "The meta analyses were carried out using MetaXL [31] and the subgroup analysis and meta regression were carried out using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA-V3) software [38].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "## Study characteristics\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of publications identified for screening was 1694. The process of selection of eligible studies are depicted as a PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 2). A total of 27 studies were found to fulfill the eligibility criteria and included in the review (Table 1). The number of neonate included in these studies was 574,692. Of these, 39,965 neonates developed confirmed NEC (Table 2). The studies covered a broader geographical areas globally. Some regions had multiple studies other areas had none. A total of eight studies were reported from the United States covering a number of states including: California, Texas, Atlanta, Connecticut, and New York [3, 6, 9, 18, 19, 39 -41]. Multiple studies were also reported from the Europe including Poland, Romania, Finland, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland [12, 13, 23, 39, 42, 43]. Also, four studies were done in China, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia [14, 16, 44, 45]. Three studies from Australia [4, 21, 46], one from the Middle East [7] and one from India [24].\n",
      "\n",
      "The publication year of the studies ranged from 1988 to 2019, but the majority were carried out after 2000. Some of the studies focused on evaluating a certain exposure [7, 9, 21, 43], however, the data presented in these papers were not limited to the exposure groups\n",

Whilst, Patole et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study reviewing 1755 neonates who were less than 34 weeks of gestation [21]. The aim was to study the effect on the incidence of NEC. In the control group (prior to the initiation of probiotic), there were 835 babies. Among those 250 were preterm with gestational age less than 28 weeks.

Such variation may be attributed to the fewer published studies from LMIC and potential under power to detect any differences. However, it is also possible that slightly lower incidence reported in LMIC may be due to higher gestational age cutoff point for resuscitation used in case of extreme prematurity. It is also possible that the sicker babies in LMIC may have had higher risk of mortality. As a result the population of neonates in LMIC may appear healthier and at lesser risk of developing NEC.\n",

This increase may be related to variations in local health services. However, findings from the analysis of the NICHD data base from the United States reported [20] showed a different picture. They reviewed VLBW infants from three epochs: 1987 -1988, 1993 -1994, and 1999 -2000. Their analysis compared the incidence across these three periods and they demonstrated that the incidence of NEC did not change over time.
