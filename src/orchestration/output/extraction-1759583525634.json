  "summary": "This neonatal intensive care unit case series reviews five preterm infants who were initially diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) but whose clinical courses were atypical and more consistent with food protein–induced enterocolitis (FPIES). The authors highlight the potential for underdiagnosis of FPIES in the premature population and suggest that careful review of symptom timing, laboratory findings, and feeding history can aid differentiation from NEC.",
  "methods": "A retrospective chart review of 56 infants diagnosed with NEC in a single NICU from 2014 to 2017 was performed. Clinical presentation, timing of symptom onset, radiologic and laboratory data, need for surgery, and relationship of symptoms to enteral feeds were collected. Five infants with atypical courses—multiple episodes, onset outside the usual NEC window, absence of leukopenia, presence of eosinophilia, and symptom resolution with feed changes—were identified and described in detail.",
  "findings": "All five atypical cases exhibited radiographic pneumatosis and recurrent feeding intolerance or hematochezia that resolved with avoidance of cow’s‑milk protein formulas. Laboratory data showed no leukopenia, occasional eosinophilia, and normal platelet counts, contrasting with typical NEC findings. The authors conclude that FPIES can mimic NEC in preterm infants and recommend heightened awareness and consideration of FPIES in similar clinical scenarios to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions."
