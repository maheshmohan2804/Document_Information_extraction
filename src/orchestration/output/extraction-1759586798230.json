  "summary": "This neonatal intensive care unit case series reviews five preterm infants initially diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) who exhibited atypical clinical courses more consistent with food protein‑induced enterocolitis (FPIES). The authors highlight the potential for FPIES to be underdiagnosed in the premature population and propose that careful review of feeding history and laboratory findings can aid differentiation.",
  "methods": "A retrospective chart review of 56 infants diagnosed with NEC in a single NICU from 2014 to 2017 was performed. Clinical presentation, timing of symptom onset, radiologic and laboratory findings, need for surgical intervention, and relationship of symptoms to enteral feeds were extracted. Five infants with atypical, relapsing courses were identified and described in detail.",
  "findings": "All five atypical cases displayed recurrent feeding intolerance and hematochezia outside the typical NEC window, with radiographic evidence of pneumatosis but no surgical intervention. Laboratory data showed absence of leukopenia and presence of eosinophilia, and symptom resolution correlated with avoidance of cow’s‑milk protein formulas. The findings suggest that FPIES can mimic NEC in preterm infants and may be underdiagnosed, underscoring the need for heightened clinical awareness and careful feeding management."
