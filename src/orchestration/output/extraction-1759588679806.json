  "summary": "This case series examines 5 atypical neonatal cases initially diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) but more consistent with food protein-induced enterocolitis (FPIES), suggesting FPIES may be underdiagnosed in NICU settings.",
  "methods": "Retrospective chart review of 56 infants diagnosed with NEC in a NICU from 2014â€“2017; 5 nonsurgical patients with atypical features (age of onset, eosinophilia, recurrent episodes, feed-related symptom timing) were selected for detailed case analysis.",
  "findings": "Five infants lacked classic NEC features such as bowel perforation or need for surgery; their symptom patterns aligned more closely with FPIES, highlighting diagnostic overlap and the potential for misclassification between NEC and FPIES in preterm infants."
