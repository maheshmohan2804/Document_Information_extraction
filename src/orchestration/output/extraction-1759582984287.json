  "summary": "This neonatal case series examines five preterm infants initially diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) who exhibited atypical clinical courses more consistent with food protein‑induced enterocolitis (FPIES). The authors review chart data from 56 NEC‑diagnosed infants in a NICU between 2014 and 2017, highlighting distinctive features such as absence of leukopenia, presence of eosinophilia, and symptom resolution with feed changes.",
  "methods": "A retrospective chart review of 56 infants diagnosed with NEC in a single NICU over a four‑year period (2014‑2017). Data collected included timing of symptom onset, radiologic and laboratory findings, need for surgical intervention, and relationship of symptoms to feeding. Five nonsurgical patients with atypical presentations were identified and described in detail.",
  "findings": "The five cases displayed clinical and laboratory patterns atypical for NEC—no leukopenia, eosinophilia, multiple episodes, and symptom resolution with changes in feeds—suggesting FPIES rather than NEC. The authors conclude that FPIES may be underdiagnosed in the preterm NICU population and can mimic NEC, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical awareness."
