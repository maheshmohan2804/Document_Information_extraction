  "summary": "This systematic review and meta‑analysis pooled data from 27 cohort studies (total = 574 692 very‑low‑birth‑weight infants) to estimate the worldwide incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The authors found that roughly **7 % of VLBW infants develop NEC**, with considerable heterogeneity across studies and a modest upward trend in reported incidence over time. The work underscores the need for higher‑quality, population‑based incidence studies—especially from low‑ and middle‑income countries—to better inform prevention strategies.\n\n---",
  "methods": "| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Study design** | Systematic review and meta‑analysis of observational cohort (prospective or retrospective) and population‑based registry studies. |\n| **Guidelines followed** | PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses). |\n| **Eligibility criteria** | • Cohort or population‑based studies reporting **incidence** of confirmed NEC in preterm or VLBW infants with a clear denominator.<br>• Excluded: RCTs, case series without denominator, studies focusing on sub‑populations where incidence could not be extracted, and studies with ambiguous NEC case definitions. |\n| **Data sources** | PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and grey‑literature sources. |\n| **Search period** | Not specified in the excerpt (search conducted up to the year of publication, 2020). |\n| **Study selection** | 27 eligible studies identified after screening. |\n| **Sample size** | **Total infants:** 574 692 VLBW neonates.<br>**NEC cases:** 39 965. |\n| **Risk‑of‑bias assessment** | Hoy et al. (2012) prevalence‑study quality tool; 17 of 27 studies scored ≥ 8/10 (low risk of bias). |\n| **Statistical analysis** | • Primary pooled estimate: **Random‑Effects Model (REM)** (DerSimonian‑Laird).<br>• Sensitivity/quality‑adjusted estimate: **Quality Effect Model (QEM)**.<br>• Heterogeneity: I² statistic, Cochrane Q‑test (I² = 100 %; Q = 7473; p < 0.0001).<br>• Subgroup analyses & meta‑regression (examined region, income level, publication year).<br>• Publication bias: Hunter’s modified funnel plot for incidence data. |\n| **Software** | Not reported in the excerpt (commonly RevMan, Stata, or R meta‑packages). |\n\n---",
  "findings": "| Finding | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Overall pooled incidence of NEC** | **7.0 %** (95 % CI = 6.0 %–8.0 %) using REM.<br>Quality‑adjusted QEM estimate: **6.0 %** (95 % CI = 4.0 %–9.0 %). |\n| **Statistical significance** | Heterogeneity highly significant (I² = 100 %; Q = 7473; p < 0.0001).<br>Meta‑regression showed a **significant increase in reported NEC incidence over calendar year** (p‑value not provided but described as statistically significant). |\n| **Regional / income‑level variation** | Incidence appeared broadly similar across regions, but **some differences were noted between high‑ and low‑income countries** (exact figures not given). |\n| **Publication bias** | Funnel‑plot inspection indicated **no evidence of publication bias**. |\n| **Risk‑of‑bias summary** | Majority of studies rated low risk; however, only ~50 % employed random sampling, contributing to methodological heterogeneity. |\n| **Conclusions** | • Approximately **1 in 14 VLBW infants** (≈ 7 %) in NICUs develop NEC.<br>• Reported incidence varies widely, reflecting clinical, health‑system, and methodological differences.<br>• The upward temporal trend suggests either a true rise or improved detection/reporting. |\n| **Implications** | • Provides a baseline global incidence for benchmarking future prevention trials and quality‑improvement initiatives.<br>• Highlights the urgent need for **large, high‑quality, population‑based incidence studies**, especially from low‑ and middle‑income settings, to identify contextual risk factors and guide resource allocation. |\n\n--- \n\n**Take‑away:** This meta‑analysis establishes that NEC remains a common and serious complication among very‑low‑birth‑weight infants worldwide, affecting roughly **7 %"
