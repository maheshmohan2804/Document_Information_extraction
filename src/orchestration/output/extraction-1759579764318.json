  "summary": "This study systematically reviewed and meta‑analysed cohort and population‑based studies that reported the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. By pooling data from 27 studies encompassing 574,692 infants, the authors estimated that approximately 7 % of VLBW infants develop NEC, while noting substantial heterogeneity across regions and over time.",
  "methods": "Study design: Systematic review and meta‑analysis following PRISMA guidelines.  \nData sources: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and grey literature.  \nEligibility: Cohort or population‑based studies (prospective or retrospective) reporting NEC incidence in preterm or VLBW infants with a clear denominator; excluded case series without denominators, randomized trials, and studies focusing on selected sub‑populations without extractable overall incidence.  \nSample size: 27 eligible studies, total of 574,692 VLBW infants, of whom 39,965 developed NEC.  \nAnalytical methods: Incidence proportions were pooled using a random‑effects model (REM) due to extreme heterogeneity (I² = 100%). A bias‑adjusted Quality Effect Model (QEM) provided sensitivity estimates. Subgroup analyses and meta‑regression explored sources of heterogeneity (e.g., geographic region, income level, publication year). Publication bias was assessed with Hunter’s modified funnel plot, Egger’s regression, and Kendall’s Tau.",
  "findings": "- Pooled NEC incidence among VLBW infants was 7.0 % (95 % CI 6.0–8.0 %) using REM; QEM yielded a similar estimate of 6.0 % (95 % CI 4.0–9.0 %).  \n- No significant publication bias was detected (Egger p = 0.80; Kendall’s Tau p = 0.936).  \n- Substantial heterogeneity existed across studies; incidence appeared similar across many regions but varied between high‑ and low‑income countries.  \n- Meta‑regression indicated a statistically significant increase in reported NEC incidence over calendar years, suggesting a temporal trend.  \n- The authors conclude that roughly one in fourteen VLBW infants in NICUs develop NEC, but the wide variability underscores the need for higher‑quality, large‑scale incidence studies, especially from low‑ and middle‑income settings, to better understand and address risk factors."
