  "summary": "This article presents a case series of five preterm infants initially diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) who exhibited atypical clinical courses suggestive of food protein‑induced enterocolitis (FPIES). The authors review chart data from 56 NEC cases in their NICU (2014‑2017) and highlight laboratory and radiographic features that differentiate FPIES from NEC.",
  "methods": "A retrospective chart review of 56 infants diagnosed with NEC in a single NICU from 2014 to 2017 was performed. Data collected included timing of symptom onset, radiologic and laboratory findings, need for surgical intervention, and relationship of symptoms to feeding. Five nonsurgical patients with atypical presentations (e.g., absence of leukopenia, presence of eosinophilia, multiple episodes, and symptom resolution with feed changes) were identified and described in detail.",
  "findings": "The study suggests that FPIES can mimic NEC in preterm infants and may be underdiagnosed. Atypical laboratory patterns (normal or elevated WBC, eosinophilia, lack of leukopenia) and clinical course (multiple episodes, improvement with feed modification) were noted. The authors conclude that clinicians should consider FPIES in infants with NEC‑like symptoms but atypical features, as early recognition may prevent unnecessary surgical interventions."
