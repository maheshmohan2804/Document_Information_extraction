**Document Summary**  
This preprint reports a prospective study of preterm infants who either remained healthy or developed suspected necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC‑1). The authors collected fecal samples during the first two months of life and performed integrated analyses of gut microbiota, microbiome, and metabolome, while also examining maternal and neonatal factors that might influence these profiles. The study identifies early microbial and metabolic signatures that distinguish NEC‑1 from healthy infants and suggests practical interventions to mitigate disease progression.  

**Research Methods**  
The study recruited a cohort of healthy preterm infants and a cohort of infants who developed NEC‑1. Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points (1–10 days, 11–20 days, 21–30 days, >30 days) over the first two months of life. Gut microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while functional potential (microbiome) was evaluated using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Fecal metabolite profiles were obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Clinical data—including enteral nutrition volume, antibiotic exposure, mode of delivery, birth weight, and gestational age—were recorded. Statistical analyses included linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to identify taxa and functional pathways that differentiate groups, principal component analysis (PCA) for metabolomic data, two‑way ANOVA with Benjamini–Krieger–Yekutieli false‑discovery‑rate correction for multiple comparisons, and enrichment analyses of pathway‑associated and SNP‑associated metabolite sets.  

**Key Findings and Conclusions**  
1. **Early Nutritional Differences** – NEC‑1 infants received a significantly lower volume of enteral nutrition by day 7 compared with healthy controls.  
2. **Microbiota Divergence** – By day 10 of life, the gut microbiota of NEC‑1 infants began to diverge from that of healthy infants, although no significant taxonomic shifts were observed later in the two‑month period.  
3. **Microbiome Alterations** – Functional profiling revealed that the NEC‑1 microbiome displayed increased restriction enzyme activity and other pathway changes as early as 21–30 days, indicating a distinct functional signature.  
4. **Metabolomic Differences** – Fecal metabolite profiles diverged more markedly between groups at the second month of life. NEC‑1 infants showed elevated levels of serine and ethanol, linked to homocysteine degradation and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis, whereas healthy infants had higher leucine, ethanol, and dihydroxyacetone, associated with branched‑chain amino‑acid degradation and ketone‑body metabolism.  
5. **Influence of Maternal and Neonatal Factors** – The NEC‑1 microbiome was more sensitive to factors such as mode of delivery (C‑section vs. vaginal birth), very low birth weight, extremely low birth weight, and gestational age ≤ 28 weeks. Antibiotic exposure in the neonate and mother also modulated microbial and metabolic profiles.  
6. **Clinical Implications** – The findings support two immediate clinical strategies: (i) increasing enteral feeding volumes during the first days of life to potentially prevent NEC‑1 development, and (ii) limiting or tailoring antibiotic therapy during the first week of life in preterm infants.  

Overall, the study provides a comprehensive, longitudinal view of how gut microbial ecology and metabolite production evolve in preterm infants at risk for NEC‑1, highlighting early biomarkers and actionable interventions.
