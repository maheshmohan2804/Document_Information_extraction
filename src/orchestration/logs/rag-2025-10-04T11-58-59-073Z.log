[2025-10-04T12:02:55.923Z] [DEBUG] Document Information  
Author(s): AA, NI  
Date: 2020 (year of publication; exact date not provided)  
Document Type: Systematic review and meta‑analysis (research article)  

Document Summary  
This study systematically reviewed cohort and population‑based reports of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants to estimate the global incidence. By pooling data from 27 studies encompassing over half a million newborns, the authors found that approximately seven percent of VLBW infants develop NEC, with notable heterogeneity across regions and an apparent increase in incidence over time.  

Research Methods  
- Design: Systematic review and meta‑analysis following PRISMA guidelines.  
- Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and grey‑literature sources.  
- Eligibility: Cohort or population‑based studies (prospective or retrospective) reporting the number or incidence of confirmed NEC in preterm or VLBW infants with a clear denominator. Excluded were randomized trials, case series without denominators, and studies focusing on selected sub‑populations where overall incidence could not be extracted.  
- Study Selection: 27 eligible studies were identified after comprehensive searching and screening.  
- Sample Size: Combined total of 574,692 VLBW infants; 39,965 cases of NEC were reported.  
- Quality Assessment: Conducted using Hoy et al. criteria; 17 of 27 studies scored ≥8/10, indicating low risk of bias.  
- Statistical Analyses:  
  * Primary pooling performed with a Random Effects Model (REM) due to extreme heterogeneity (I² = 100%, Cochrane Q = 7473, p < 0.0001).  
  * Sensitivity analysis using a bias‑adjusted Quality Effect Model (QEM).  
  * Subgroup analyses by geographic region and country income level.  
  * Meta‑regression to explore sources of heterogeneity, including publication year as a covariate.  
  * Publication bias assessed with Hunter’s modified funnel plot appropriate for incidence data.  

Key Findings and Conclusions  
- Pooled incidence of NEC among VLBW infants was 7.0 % (95 % CI 6.0–8.0 %) using REM; QEM yielded a comparable estimate of 6.0 % (95 % CI 4.0–9.0 %).  
- No evidence of publication bias was detected in funnel‑plot analyses.  
- Incidence estimates were broadly similar across regions, though some differences emerged between high‑ and low‑income countries.  
- Meta‑regression demonstrated a statistically significant upward trend in NEC incidence over calendar years, suggesting a possible increase over time.  
- The very high heterogeneity (I² = 100 %) indicates substantial variability likely driven by differences in clinical practices, health‑system factors, and methodological approaches among the included studies.  
- Conclusions: Roughly one in fourteen VLBW infants admitted to NICUs worldwide will develop NEC, but the wide variation underscores the need for high‑quality, standardized incidence studies—especially from low‑ and middle‑income settings—to better understand and ultimately reduce the burden of this disease.
